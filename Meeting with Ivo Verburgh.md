Bottlenecks are people who can't adapt to implementing new & improved autonomous ways of working.
	In comes the I.T GUY who's a classical example of a bottleneck
		1.  The most handsome employee in the building.
		2.  He can fix your computer.
		3.  He has a good joke.
	-  Is always willing to 'help' not from a good company aspect, but from disassociation.
	-  Always does what's asked of them.

Opposite this a dev needs to ask and keep in mind:
	1. Priority.
	2. Is it Good for the Team.

The downside of having/working with the I.T GUY:
	The company can become very dependent on them.
	They become a liability.
##### THE BUS FACTOR 

How stable is your production or your organization is without relying on any one/single persons. {{time: 21:06 in voice recorder}}
###### YOU NEED A TEAM OF SUPERHEROES, NOT A 'BUS FACTOR'

i.e. `The Avengers`
& similarly you need a team that's good in different areas respectively.
`Great things in business are never done by on eperson, they're done by a team of people  - Steve Jobs`

#### THE T-SHAPED SOFTWARE ENGINEERS

- Have deep knowledge in one "key" are and have a good enough working knowledge of everything else in the Team/Organization.
##### THE E SHAPE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
############# *==Posses these qualities:==*
- EXPERTISE
- EXPERIENCE 
- EXECUTION
- EXPLORATION 

These characteristics tie in to one another perfectly as: 
`EXPLORATION leads to growing EXPERTISE & likewise EXPERIENCE and that is highly fostered by EXECUTION*`

- SKILL MATRIX TEMPLATES 
	-Are a way to visualize each Team Members skill proficiency in a particular knowledge or specialization.
			This helps a Team see where they need to invest more members in, and where a team is greatly proficient.
	- Skill Matrixes can also be used to learn new skills (as an individual)

MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMAND OF SKILL IS EQUIVALENT TO THE AVAILABILITY IN YOUR TEAM.

 - GOOD ENGINEERS BALANCE LEARNING, THEIR SPECIALIZATION AND DELIVERY

`When a team is not Dynamic enough or the available SKILLS aren't in DEMAND mitigate this by leveling the stress load on everyone:  this includes balancing everyones LEARNING, SPECIALTIES AND DELIVERY`

"IMPROVING DAILY WORK IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN DOING DAILY WORK"  [-Gene Kim](-Gene%20Kim.md) //Who wrote  [[`The Phoenix Project`, `The Unicorn Project`, `The DevOps Handbook`]]

	> 	 Everyone WANTS change, yet no one WANTS TO change.

Being a leader means letting people know that's it's okay to be outside your comfort zone, and helping them get tho the learning and growth zone(s)

- Leaders show vulnerability, they have "empathy" & a high [ESI](./ESI.md)

###### KNOWLEDGE DISTRIBUTION

Include: 
- Swarming
- Mobbing
- Pair-Programming
- Automate things that are repeated {more than three times} - this alleviates human prone mistakes and ensures more reliable systems and teams.

###### KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION

- Can come from peers.
- Everyone meets (like movie night) & we have a chance to share a few things we learnt recently.
	-If intrigued, find time to learn the knowledge.
	-Share what you learned.
	-Learn something else (Optionally)
	-Repeat process.

### FOOTNOTES

What Ivo characterizes as a real hero: From his Idol "Bill"
	- Always on duty 
	- Always knows a solution, especially in tough situations
	- Writes code superfast and precise
	- Knows what the customer wants (Didn't mean that he cared though, lol) - `dev's rarely know a customer's domain that well`
	- Has a strong opinion on what's right and what's wrong.

The Dunning Kruger Effect

- Confidence has a direct correlation to competence.

Building reliable infrastructure requires: 

A SYSTEMS THAT'S  BUILT IN A WAY THAT ISN'T BREAKABLE IF ONE SIDE OR INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN IT IS FAULTY.

- Collective Knowledge.
	-Capture that knowledge, create a protocol or a process that can be used to teach other people how to acquire this knowledge.
	-Record your virtual meetings.
	
### HERO CULTURE

- PROMOTES FIREFIGHTING OVER PREVENTING ISSUES, CAUSING ESCALATIONS TO BECOME THE NORM
- CRISIS DEMANDS DISRUPT REGULAR WORK, LEADING TO MISSED COMMITMENTS IN SPRINTS.
- CUSTOMES EXPLOIT THE COMPANY'S REACTIVE APPROACH, GAINING MORE LEVERAGE.

#### ERGO TO COUNTER THIS: 

- BE A REPLACEABLE HERO, NOT A CLASSIC ONE
- PRAISE TEAMS THAT WORK AS SUSTAINABLE SPEED AND KEEP IMPROVING & LEARNING 
- LEARN FROM DISASTERS, MAKE SURE THEY ARE FIXED BY WHOLE TEAM.


#### PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE DISTRIBUTION

	- PEER DEMOS
	- TEACHING ALL THE NEW STUFF YOU LEARN TO YOUR TEAM
	- CREATING A PROCESS (IDEALLY STEP BY STEP OR HOW TO GUIDE a.k.a WIKI) ON KNOWLEDGE THAT IS IN DEMANDED AND NOT REALLY READILY AVAILABLE.

# Questions 
	What is 'Kaizen'?
		>CHINESE PHILOSOPHY. EMBRACE CHANGE.
	How do you manage/handle the people in the environment that don't want the change or are resistent to it?
		>BUILD UNDERSTANDING, ASK THEM FOR THEIR INPUT.
	How would you suggest/What would you say is the best way to no become a reactive programmer and similarly not fall victim to the HERO CULTURE
		>EXPLORATION
		>E SHAPED ENGINEERS CAN BENEFIT EACH BY LEANING ON WHAT THEY ARE THE BEST AT, SO THOSE THAT ARE GOOD AT LEARNING SHOULD WORK WITH THOSE THAT CAN EXECUTE REALLY WELL.
