# NOTE

Step 1. ^ddf7cc

- The first step in design thinking is empathy, get into the shoes of your consumer, develop a better understanding about your consumer.
	- _What can you tell us about what you do?_
	- _Could you describe a typical day at work?_
	- _Could you tell us a bit about yourself and your company._
	- _What do you love about your company, what's the one thing you don't like a lot..._ etc...

- Some stuff we could do to further understand the client/consumer:
	- Immerse ourselves in what they do, so ask questions like:
		- _Could we try to use your current system for ourselves or could you walk us through what it looks like to navigate your current system._
		-For this [Empathy maps](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it) can help a lot, they capture what people say, think and feel contextually. They can also help us understand the context of the problem and how the consumer is experiencing it too.

Step 2.

- Now that we have some information from [[#^ddf7cc]] (Step 1) We use this data to compile a ==*A human-centric problem statement that should be captured from the perspective of the consumer.*==  
		- _==For example, instead of setting a goal to increase signups by 5%, a human-centered target would be to help busy moms provide healthy food for their families.==_

	- IN A NUTSHELL, BASED ON THE FRUSTRATIONS AND THINGS THE CONSUMER IS NOT HAPPY WITH, WE COME UP WITH QUESTIONS FOR HOW WE MIGHT SOLVE THEM.
	- ####### `Typical Activities that can help formulate our solutions:` 
	
		- `**Clustering and Themes:** There are a lot of different ways to go about the Define phase, but it’s safe to say you’ll need a wall of sticky notes; these will be filled with the quotes, observations, and ideas you heard throughout your research. Group and cluster ideas together until you find the prevailing or most prominent themes.`
		- `**Problem Statement:** Take time to properly articulate the [problem statement.](https://voltagecontrol.com/downloads/problem-statement-mural/) Answer the following questions: 1) What is the problem? 2) Who has the problem? 3) Where is the problem? 4) Why does it matter`
	-IN THIS STEP IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE ALL OF THE CONSUMERS PROBLEMS BUT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO IDENTIFY THEIR MOST PAINFUL ISSUE AND FROM THAT, WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD (IN OTHER WORDS )
