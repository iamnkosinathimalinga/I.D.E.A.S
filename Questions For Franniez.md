Step 1. ^ddf7cc

- The first step in design thinking is empathy, get into the shoes of your consumer, develop a better understanding about your consumer.
	- _What can you tell us about what you do?_
	- _Could you describe a typical day at work?_
	- _Could you tell us a bit about yourself and your company._
	- _What do you love about your company, what's the one thing you don't like a lot..._ etc...

- Some stuff we could do to further understand the client/consumer:
	- Immerse ourselves in what they do, so ask questions like:
		- _Could we try to use your current system for ourselves or could you walk us through what it looks like to navigate your current system._
		-For this [Empathy maps](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it) can help a lot, they capture what people say, think and feel contextually. They can also help us understand the context of the problem and how the consumer is experiencing it too.

- Now that we have some information from [[#^ddf7cc]] (Step 1) We use this data to compile a $*A human-centric problem statement that should be captured from the perspective of the consumer.*$
