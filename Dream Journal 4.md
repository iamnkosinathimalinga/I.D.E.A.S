Last Night's/ This Morning's partial dream was actually not partial because I recall remembering it before I went back to sleep a second time.  
  
so the earliest parts I remember is of looking for a job in a road that seemed so familiar, I feel like the road is on the OR Tambo area and it had a lot of restaurants and stuff nearby anyway I walked by there the first time looking over and stuff and seeing a lot of guys in uniform(for work) and I wasn't really interested in that whole biz and after that there was a place, I don't know exactly what it was for but there were experiments going on there and long story short I was there and me and this other person, decided to destroy the area, after successfully doing that, we got trapped there in the last building that stood there and the person who owns that building trapped us there kept us locked there and I convinced them to keep us as dogs for their kid instead of killing us.  
  
he did and we found out there was another lady who survived and while she didn't survive long she gave us ample opportunity to escape the facilities the first to go was the other person I was with and although she didn't get far she gave me an opportunity to make a run for it and I did & ended up in that district of restaurants from earlier and I ended up taking any job just to get away from where I was.  
the other minor details don't matter I feel.  
but the one that does is I had this weird premonition, where I knew it was a dream, inside the dream, and got confused when I asked someone about some guys in work uniform standing, about what they were standing there for, and the guy replied, they're valet, and I was like dang, how could I know that, but at the same time not know that, in my own dream? seems a bit weird right.  
  
so in conclusion I should do a lot more dream research.
