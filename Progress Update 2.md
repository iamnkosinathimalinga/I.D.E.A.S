# NOTE

Today went a bit slower, but was able to put in a bit of time at home and finish chapter 6 of [SQL - Headfirst](./SQL%20-%20Headfirst.md), Daily Report: [SQL - Headfirst](./SQL%20-%20Headfirst.md#^ebf893)


**The assignment** was giving me a bit of an issue which i estimate will need me to add approximately 4 blocks to it at home so that I can understand why my updateScore tests are failing. Other than that I can't complain, everything is a bit behind but at a manageable rate, minimum viable product is still on schedule.
