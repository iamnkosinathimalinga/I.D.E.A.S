# NOTE

What a bloody c*nt.
	You know I think for the longest time, I always feared the day when you'd eventually reveal your true self (your "not-so-holy" side, if I can even call it that) but to my surprise, the anticipation and the trepidation trumped the grand reveal. 

Today, was nothing if not enlightening, on many a counts...
	You are a gimmick, a poser, a self-proclaiming "saint" who'd no sooner choke on her own delusions than admit she's in over her head. 
	
> 	Don't get me wrong you're fiercely headstrong & thus far you've been a pretty decent person (at-least that's what I thought ) but despite your triumphs and all your tribulations,  God Almighty, still couldn't save the selfish prick you turned out to be. You're a Christian through-and-through, and none the wiser for it might I add.

You're sketchy as hell, and where there's smoke...
	Honestly, I'm just as shady, if not a a lot more, alas the main difference remains to be in our shenanigans (this is completely subject to my personal experience) -& to be fair, a lot of people aren't exactly privy or at all inclined to pondering especially not about their fucked up selves, & that holds on Global scales too. 
	
See we've this tendency of not being able to smell our own **shit**." -To put it quite plainly: It's part of the notorious "human-condition" I suppose, & as much as I want to say grow up, I can's bring myself to even spout those words, let alone think them. At least not without feeling a tad bit like a massive failure, & of course who the hell is going to take that from the junky-dead-beat-stupid-retard...(I could go on for at least a couple more sentences I think, and that's me being a fair bit modest) 

	-nonetheless I think my point here is that as much as it irks and churns my insides. I'm quite the same, in fact I'm worse, because I was at least privy to some substantially indifferent genetic pools and it's that indifference, be it does a service that's worthwhile, often times it's the same indifference that leads me to reason & justify this never ending angst against myself. In turn not,  
	smack dab in the middle of paralysis, where I get the 'awesome' and 'fun' self-prescribed mental (I can't even use the word "torture" here because that wouldn't do the experience justice) -so for a lack thereof, We'll call it 'decay' & hopefully you can get a picture of what it's like to be dealt a bad hand while shooting oneself in the foot. It's a double-mind-fuckery that you just can't imagine, it's one of those " you gotta try it before you knock it experiences " and o'-boy is it a doozey.

I can't wait to shower you with karma.
	The sub, for this one is a bit misleading because despite my obvious distaste for your lack of self-actualization, and some fucking grit (say what you mean, do what you need, and if you can't, at least be honest about it, to: if no one else, yourself) 
	
	Because karma is actually pretty awesome, and every time I'm even remotely reminded of the many people that have been kind to me or of how much kindness I've been blessed with, I'm a left awe-struck for sure. The number isn't much too high as you'd imagine it's barely over two digits but still, it says a lot about the 'lot of ya', and I for one, never let a good deed go unpunished. 
	
	 I honestly wish that whatever happens I get to show you that behind my facade of a "life" there is a tiny (extremely tiny) smidgen of "good" and dare I say repentance in my own strange & justified way. 
	 
	 I can't even remember a time when kindness was given unto me at times when things were "good" or "okay." All those moments,highlights, & feats are in my opinion to this day: staggering to even reminisce over. Because those "moments" remain the rarest & truest of treasures: in my heart and in my proverbial soul. I certainly intend on paying it forward. 
	 
I'm probably 300000% responsible for fucking this whole thing up.
	Yeah, yeah, yeah, spare me. I know.
	- Excuses: none in sight.
	- Reasons: I'm a bloody idiotic wanker.
	- The consequences speak for themself: A lot of lonely nights, some better than others, mostly: absolutely shite. Alas, there's always a silver lining or a some seed sown that has to be reaped, and I bet it's going to be one heck of a Harvest.
	- I have no - "I'm sorry's", no "I'll do better's", no repertoire or even slightly witty remarks. Not even a funny stories. No comeback, fokkol. 
	
	I'm legit just a bare-minimum ugly motherfucker who couldn't keep his dick in his pants long enough to at least, if anything not have to feel responsible for where we are right now.

God, did me a kindness.
	Whether it was fated, conspired, planned or whatever the hell t'was. I'm glad it brought you to my ever so fucked up small little world. Truly I am grateful. This isn't one of those, 
	
	"grateful-goodbyes", no, it's a fair bit more genuine than that. 
	
You actually impacted my life positively,  such a ridiculous feat and in such a short span of time, honestly no words can ever express how profoundly this: Albeit: "*badly written excerpt*" means to a nobody like myself. 

	I really want you to be my family, but as you very well know I'm fucked. I can't even help it, it's my "human-condition" and I've come to accept it as such, made the terms, wrote the conditions, dotted the T's crossed the I's, and got a fairly reasonable agreement in store for myself. Nonetheless, you should know that no matter how side-ways it all goes: this is a deal **I** alone made, & a bed **I** alone will lay in. I see how unfair it's been to get you involved in all that, so the least I could do is write: "*the craziness is real*", "**the psychological depravity is real, the need for an "unnecessary amount of grandeur"**" is most abso-fucking-lutely real too. Let me wrap up today's (technically: start it off today - since it's past midnight) **-on a task {{completed}}**, & a bit of a sadnote. Heck that's not even sad news anymore anyway, lol. 
	
	I'll leave this piece here: & end it with this, & it's probably not worth it, but what the heck: 
		I honestly don't know if I'm worth this much hassle, so cut your losses and make like the wind, we both know that you're not going to lose anything too valuable, & who knows: maybe with a shit ton of time, and some grinding, I'll be cool with you, & yes: your friends(Moms, Jnr, practically & all your no.1 fans will still be there for you, minus a couple awkward  moments with me now & again) You'll still keep doing you, and live out your reasonably satisfactory life, and life will move on. 


P.S
		I totally thought I had a shit ton of shit to say, but it turns out it was a little over a thousand words, huh, surprising, 
		
		I guess things really do seem huge in the heat of the moment, looking at it now, it's like "What-a-hell" lol, 
			Je ne sais pais though man Nala, it's like we keep fighting one-another to make them happy, and really that's not no reason to fight someone, 
			fight me because I'm amoral  or whatever, or because I don't post you, (that's actually another fine example of you fighting me because of some conditioning that's taken root in your mind) -but I'm sidetracking again, point is this (I think): 
			
			THINK FOR YOUR FUCKING SELF, YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE, WRITE A DIFFERENT STORY, A NARRATIVE THAT HASN'T BEEN WORN-OUT. YOU'RE NOT SOME DAMSIL IN ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS, COME THE FUCK ON. "
			OR IS THAT ME ASKING FOR A MIRACLES AGAIN?" 
			
				---*(*something really cool, and concluding here, that'll makes you love me a whole lot, and we end up in Paris, or anywhere really, 
				having conversations that don't exist in someone else's mind already, just us, doing us. nothing fabricated...just pure. then a-one-&-a-two and-a-high-five-we-do, hahaha. & SCENE!)
