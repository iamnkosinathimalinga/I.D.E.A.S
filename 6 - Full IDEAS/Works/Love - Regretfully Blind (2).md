# Love - Regretfully Blind

You know, I don't regret meeting you.  
I regret not being able to protect you.  
I regret not being there.  
I regret judging you.  
I regret not loving you the way you needed.  
I regret hurting you.  
I regret not standing up for you.  
I regret not staying up for you.  
I regret meeting you years after I wish I did.  
I regret a lot of things I said.  
I regret being another reason you fled.  
I regret watching him hurt you till you bled.  
I regret not telling you, I'm scared too.  
I regret not being imperfect with you.  
Most of all, I regretfully can't take it back,  
nor can I give you back,  
your innocence, your love, your truth, your faith, your empathy, your story, your privacy, your childhood, your forgiveness, your passion, your strength, your greatness, & your future.  
I can't give you all that back because I'm not the one who stole it.  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry the world stole a part of you.  
I'm sorry the universe filled you with empty space.  
I'm sorry the heavens only brought pain and suffering to you.  
I'm sorry you've never been heard, seen or touched by one that loves you deeply.  
I'm sorry people turned on you. I'm sorry they never noticed you crying for help. I'm sorry they still don't see you.  
I call you my moon but really you're the space behind it,  
dark, vast, empty and filled with endless wonder.  
it's a shame you'll never see me the way I see you,  
it brings my heart sorrow to know you'll never believe I never meant to treat you worse than they did, that I didn't know I was your safe haven, I'm sorry you'll never see I'm merely the manifestation of everything inside you, everything beautiful, and weird and funny and stupid and awe inspired, quirky, real, fake, damaged, healthy, toxic, every single piece of you that you don't see, is every single piece of you I am. I know this because, you're my everything, my darkness, my vast unexplored depths, my wonder, my anger, my hurt, my fear, my never ending void, and without you, there is no me.  
How sorry I am that you'll never see how empty you are without me.  
  
  
Love, yours
