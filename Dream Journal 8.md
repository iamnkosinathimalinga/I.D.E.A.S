So this is like the third dream I had today because I kept on sleeping and waking up and so basically what I remember bout this one is that I was in like a resort and me and my family had booked two rooms one for me and the other for them.  
  
their one had like a compass & chessboard, some other stuff too and then mine had like this other woman who seemed like a witch just in there doing some voodoo stuff, she was old and fat. all that happened after I had woken up late for checkout time and I was hurrying back to my room on the way, there were so many obstacles to overcome, like for one I kept bumping into Elio, who seemed shocked to see me in a good area, first, then second time I bumped into him I was messy and all around fucked up looking, everyone around seemed to look their best it was overwhelming but I kept going because I had to make it in time anyway I ran into sindi who didn't help in not wasting my time.  
  
I kept holding doors for them unnecessarily, swinging them around and catering for their irrational fears but it's there I saw my limits and my body tell me my limits, which was in a weird way, because it wrote how many hours and how much power I put in that day, it was 1 hour and about 427 power, on that day alone, while I ran back home I figured out that it was weird my body wrote that stuff, I started thinking that I was bionic or an alien or just a super human or something anyway I eventually made it back and when I found that I was too late for both the rooms and checkout, I broke down and cried and some guy who looked like he'd been waiting there for hours looked at his compass which was pointing at me and cried with me, as he asked what brought me there at that exact time, anyway I ended up there with him and it just felt like destiny, it was an old guy who seemed like he was going to help me.
