“It should be a man's task, says the Imitation, 'to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.' 'In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.' 'Let us set the axe to the root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.' To this end there must be continual self - examination.  
  
'If thou may not continually gather thyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the evening.  
  
In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, and thought.” by Marcus Aurelius
