Containers are a convenient way to store files and easily keep track of where those files are stored. This is done by Implementing a [[4 - Indexes/Containers/{{ContainerType}}]] which is similar to an [[Indexer]] (which groups similar Tags in reference like structure, ergo the name "Index-er") j A [[4 - Indexes/Containers/{{ContainerType}}]] is more accessible, loosely coupled and easy to use. It eliminates the need to have an [[Indexer]] since [[Tags]] already get stored in a [[4 - Indexes/Containers/Container Elements/{{ContainerElementType}}]] which is { ofContainerType } 

There are currently 4 [[Containers]], namely: 

	[[Personal]]
			with [[ContainerElement]]
			Note
			MIsc
			Reflect
			Work
			To-Do
			Task
			Book
	Work
	Refactor
	Learning
	Books
		& TASK

Personal is pretty self explanatory, it's pretty much things that I find useful or noteworthy, nothing fancy, it contains elements:
	Notes
	Miscellaneous
	Management
> This will most likely house a lot of stuff from Source Material.
