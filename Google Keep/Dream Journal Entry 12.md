Last Night's or rather this morning's partial dream is about a house and rather extending that house it was so weird though because pieces of the house were dispositional to others it almost seemed a doll house in other parts. Malum Seti was there he owed me money or rather uMusa money since we borrowed with the direct and sole purpose of him bringing it back ASAP.

there was also dine buggies or mini race cars that we were racing don't exactly remember who or what we were doing on em but we were at carnival and a bunch of stuff happened and at first I was so confused by being chosen to go on a plane and go to this tournament I guess, there were stuff about in and outside the area, and our couch seemed like he believed in us for some reason and even though we didn't it was comforting to have that or to rather, hear that. oh yeah in our race no one won because we all crashed our dune buggies.

there was also this thing about drugs nabo siyabonga and awards and magubuda. he kept on bullying siya, magubuda that is. and there was sandile there who kept on doing drugs that were spilt.
I picked up a few but never did any.
