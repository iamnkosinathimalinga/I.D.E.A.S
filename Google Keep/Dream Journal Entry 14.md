Partial Dream Entry, 

I remember Kea being there, I was trying to win her over I think I remember her being the woman of my dreams and me wanting nothing more than her there was also something about a bike or skateboard or something oh yeah, there was this guy who had an avanza and then I took it or something, went around in it because his med didn't want him cheating because of it. Also Lerato was there, I remember being at her house her sister in law was smoking week and I don't know something weird was happening with her...I can't quite recall it tho.
