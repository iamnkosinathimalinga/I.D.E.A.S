• Success, however you define it, is achievable if you collect the right field-tested beliefs andhabits. 

• The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc.) are nearly allwalking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths. ( You don’t “succeed” because you have no weaknesses; you succeed because you find your uniquestrengths and focus on developing habits around them. )
