Thesis: A sort of disillusioned psyche, wherein mind inhibits self-realism inferences.

Case Study: Let's take a child(female) who isn't particularly within any sort of class categorization yet, growing up with fosters, who are considerably wealthy, from a financial standpoint. Let's assume the young child gets adopted age 6 and was fostered at age 4. Although it's relatively brief & spent in her supposedly earlier developmental years of growth, this somewhat forgetful phase of one life's, proves to be the driving 'force', if you will, in her adult & later years.  

Analytical Model: Based on prevalent signs, indicating symptoms synonymous to early on-set dissociative disorder, the lack in evidence, in this case makes it harder to give a comparatively accurate analysis.
