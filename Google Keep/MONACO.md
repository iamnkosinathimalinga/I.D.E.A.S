Huh-huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh, huh-huh
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
 
Tell me, tell me, is this what you wanted?
I’m refined, this is gallery-worthy trap
You’re garbage, Rocky The Kid, a filth
I’m a champion, Rocky Marciano, Rocky Balboa, Rocky Maivia
I have the route, I have the way, yes, I have the way
Expenses at night, I cash out all day
So much money that, that I like to
Get praised, that’s why I can hit all these sluts
Y’all don’t know what’s like being at high seas with two hundred bodies
To have the stewardess suck your dick in the sky
What is like to throw five hundred thousand at the whorehouse
That’s why I don’t care about your opinion at all
That’s why you’re 101 on the top 100 and I’m first
They’re not rappers anymore, now they’re podcast hosts
My barber is charging more than you
Fucking and traveling the entire world, hey
 
Drinking lots of champagne, we’re never dry
First came Verstappen, then Checo came
If Pablo saw me, he’d say I’m outstanding
You’re talking shit and me and my gang are in Monaco
Drinking lots of champagne, we’re never dry
Y’all are talking with yourselves, talking with the echo
Money sign, that’s my new zodiac
I light a cigar, family is in Monaco
 
Just yesterday I was twenty years old
I caressed time, and enjoyed life
As we played with love, and I lived the night
Without counting on my days, which were fleeing in time
 
Trust me, F1 cars seem faster in person
Sofía Vergara is pretty, but she’s prettier in person
Whatever you do doesn’t impress me
It’s like scoring a goal after Messi and Maradona
You aren’t known even at your own neighborhood
Yesterday I was with LeBron, also with Di Caprio
They asked how I did at the stadiums
We spoke about family and millionaire’s matters
I mean, multimillionaire, I mean, heh, billionaire
I’ve been giving no fucks about the radio for a while
I left trap a while ago, I left it to Eladio
Ouch, heh, dear diary
Today I got a deposit and got nominated for a GRAMMY
I got criticized once again and I didn’t care one time
I’m still at ease, doing my thing
Don Vito, Don Beno, of The Beatles, John Lennon
When I die, I’ll leave my grandchildren a hundred terrains
To all my misses I’ll leave them butt cheeks and breasts
And to my haters, an F40 without breaks
 
For what? So that they crash, heh, so that they die
Red, white, matte black, which one do you want?
For what?, so that they crash, so that they die
May they rest in peace, I’m still on the yacht, hey
 
Drinking lots of champagne, we’re never dry
First came Verstappen, then Checo came
If Pablo saw me, he’d say I’m outstanding
You’re talking shit and me and my gang are in Monaco
Drinking lots of champagne, we’re never dry
Y’all are talking with yourselves, talking with the echo
Money sign, that’s my new zodiac
I light a philly, family is in Monaco
 
Just yesterday I was twenty years old
I caressed time, and enjoyed life
As we played with love, and I lived the night
Without counting on my days, which were fleeing in time
