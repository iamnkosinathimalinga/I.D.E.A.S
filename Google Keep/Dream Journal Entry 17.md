There was also this sister by the pakis and I asked her for change for a twenty and she said no, and I remember I was nervous about missing the cab because I was waiting too long by the paki , but I went there and got a tenner & some coins and then she was now asking me for change, which I gave her and then wethere was a lady(not sure if it was the same one) who sat next to me in a cab, with a kid who I played with. {the coin had a 5 rand}
