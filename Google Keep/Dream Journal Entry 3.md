Had a pretty weird partial dream again, uhm the part I remember most is when I found my nikey socks torn and I blamed my grandad and I got so angry at him I got out of the car we were in, oh before that, I had like three friends in a car with me and we were going down the road to see Nkosi I think. and then I got out halfway there by that Food poszie by the pakkies and ran back home with the intent of like shitting on the nigga or something, afterwards the road seemed really long and there were so many obstacles that I had to climb and jump through to get back home but I finally cleared all of them and then this girl stopped me for something and yeah from there, I had a laundry basket with clothes in and people started looking at me, kinder like they were shocked I even had any clothes, afterwards, I'm not really sure what happened but something happened inside a room & I wanna say one of my neighbours barged in that room or something but yeah I'm not really sure of how the whole thing unfolded.
