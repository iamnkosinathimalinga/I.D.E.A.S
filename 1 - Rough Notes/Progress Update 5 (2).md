# NOTE

Today was fairly brazen, nothing really to report on in, I'm about to work on my TDD assignment, then I will work on my Block-11-Assignment and see how far I get there. 

Had an amazing conversation with my mom about [[Self-Awareness]] and personal development, & oh my God man, I love that woman's sheer brilliance, like how fair is it that you get to be book smart and street smart, no way God did that!? Lol. Anyway;

### Task Progress

I completed some nominal tasks today, it's just this and what I mentioned earlier that still needs doing and also I should start tracking how long it takes me to complete a task based on what kind of task it is.
		On that note I will now implement a new [[Container System Schematic]] that will be implemented throughout my files (local and Cloud) My browsers, my to-do lists and anything else I use to group a lot of items of the same type or nature. 
			This will be a big task so I will start by changing and implementing my local and Cloud files first. 
				Then I will implement this on my browsers.
					Then I will implement this on my Z.K (Including all files inside of folders, and add tags for each container element)
						Then I will implement this in To-Do
							Then I will Implement this in any other MISC files that remain outside of containers.
