27 – 02 – 2024 - Entry #1

Felt a bit disappointed in herself because of letting things get a bit too far with not fixing the machine she uses to sow. Also felt well, and in balance with her emotions.

- Feels a bit hurt (more so hates that she is getting older) that she is getting older & she isn’t exactly where she wants to be by age 25. Mentioned a bible book about Solomon? Not sure there. (Ecclesiastes) & also mentioned being in a confused state of life.
    

  

- Where does she want to be? Ideally, she would have loved to have been -married with 2 kids, stable career, HR prac, studying towards a master’s degree.
    

  

- Mentioned (wanting to) (be)ing a mother.
    
- Wants to be independent (From her parents), weighed options, came to the conclusion of renting. 
    

Hates the idea of renting.

- Mentioned a mental shift.
    

- Thought of going to live with Grandfather in P.E
    
- Worries about her father being clingy
    
- Doesn’t know what she wants, feels confused, and hates that.
    
- Doesn’t feel ready for church, wants to explore more outside of that.
    
- Feels like she’s running out of time.
    
- Has a lot she’s thinking about from the past.
    
- Mentioned putting herself out there, loving her body, herself, making friends, and exploring other things that young Bongi was afraid to do.
    

- -Mentioned some of the crazy things she wants to do/has done (Entered a pageant competition, chickened out half way, paid a lot of money to enter it, secondly, she made herself “pee”)
    
- Also felt like it was a breakthrough for her to tell me all these things because of her “childhood-trauma”
    
- Mentioned not having a good relationship with her younger self. (Wanted to live as her younger self to rectify what happened to herself – Is letting go of her childhood & transitioning into adulthood)
    
- Mentioned the incident that happened when she was a kid with her mother and haw now, she has gotten over it, and takes it as a pleasurable moment rather than a traumatic one, and how that ties back to everything.
    
- Feel/Believes that I am a paradoxical person, in the sense that, she doesn’t think I am ordered in my thinking.
