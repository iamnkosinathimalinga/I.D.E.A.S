Task<[[To-Do#^fac043]] > Not Done.
# NOTE

This had initially been a task I thought would take me 20 minutes, I would use [[KeyMap#^4b27e4]] => G.C. From Chat/Co-Pilot, but it turns out that I was sadly mistaken, I am going to just have to manually go through the drudgery of maintaining and adding each element (U.I. Icon) I come by while I use the I.D.E. which just seems like such a hassle, although: some silver lining was that I got the M.S Documentation on how they implement all the icons and what they mean, so yeah, I guess the grain of salt in that, is the fact that Microsoft's documentation is lengthy as hell, but beggars can't be choosers I suppose.
