# Lyrics
  
What's there to talk about? When people around me keep saying they get it, & get it, forget it as soon as they make it out. What do we talk about, when nobody listen, we all tryna talk a lot, i guess issa word amounts, we call it the word of mouth, but really it's playing right,  
in the wrong place, for the third time, after full time it's a ghost town, shawty call late for a up date, I'm up late like updates, my mama call & say I miss you, i love my baby like my momma do, got a real love for my brother too, that's a rare love I gotta to, prayin' they will never misuse, I never gotta see you to the E. Room, come they up late
