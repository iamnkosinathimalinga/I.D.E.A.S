<intro>  
  
uh, oh (vocalized)  
  
don't really need the accolades I need the water, (water)  
fucking with your thotty that's your daughter,  
(daughter)  
I don't want no problems I can't solveuh  
(no I don't)  
property & meâ€”rarely flex! (that's a flex)  
I don't wanna tap it if it's not estate, na-na,  
I don't wanna trap if it's not my plate, na-na, (uh, yeah,yeah)  
Baby face it, you just won't replace me, (baby face)  
Got a taste for the steak, baby can't make no mistake (gotta taste)  
We don't play about the money, what you make?  
Where you staying baby come in take your place,  
Don't give a fuck about no colour when I race,  
Baby iced out cold, but she fake. (that's a fake)'3  
  
-She tryna make it to the top just toppin'  
just talkin',  
bitch get walkin',  
  
this ain't what you thought, I ain't fucking who  
you thought,  
I'm about to put the work in, fuck a thotty,  
I ain't gotta put no work in, this ain't really workin'  
she wanna get a burkin,  
(like she deservin')  
drop a number from a desk that's a lap top, (click)  
I can let my mama down I'm not a flip flop,(disk)  
You just wanna a rolli & a thotty here's a tip, stop,  
Gotta rollin' in a phantom fuck a tick tock.  
I needa better life for everybody that I got,  
& anybody cooking tryna feed em' with the pot,  
you be shooting opps, dodging cops, in a camo,  
we been high since the six dropped fuego,  
we been tight since a tight suit tie, (oh)  
we been flyin' since MJ got fly,(swish)  
been lootin' shops, breaking bands, with the famo,
