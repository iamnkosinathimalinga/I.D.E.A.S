# Lyrics

Cloud 9 w/ you  
okay you don't really have to even fake it, I know you want these niggas with the fashion, but baby they ain't gonna give you passion, you don't even have to really ask me,  
  
I just got from the show, so how about you come on over  
I make you roll on over,  
hit you from the back,  
give you heart attack,  
  
  
I just wanna ride southside with you  
I just wanna know what you like  
I just wanna ride southside with you  
& do it every time  
  
I shared love with you  
you said it's you or the music  
now I can't even leave you off the music  
  
  
you been rolling at night  
and you never at my side  
I  
  
wanna know if I can love you  
wanna know if you alone  
why you never at home b  
  
I been on the calling,  
you don't answer on the phone b,  
you  
  
  
  
Sometimes I'm Somebody Else  
somebody stay in my mind  
somebody laying in my bed  
I never lay I stay  
voices in my head say I'm dead(head)  
  
voices in my head  
noise up in my head  
  
hagale, always ahead  
I ain't deal with no hate  
you gonna lay in my bed  
hundreds on my shawty I'm lit  
hundreds in my hands I'm lit  
I ain't deal with no deal  
  
voices in my head  
voices in my head(head)  
  
quelqu'un dans ma t锚te  
Je ne te baise  
plus avec toi  
  
I never knew where you stayed  
you were always on the move  
now you wanna stay,  
I make moves so I can't stay,  
  
somebody stay in my mind  
somebody laying in my bed  
I never lay I stay  
voices in my head(head)  
  
Je ne suis pas en train  
de ne pa's, plus  
I never lay,  
I stay,  
  
ain't nobody quite like me,  
ain't nobody quite like me,  
.  
now they always say I'm dead  
noise up in my head I'm lit  
never get enough I'm lit  
  
I gotta get you in my bed  
everybody saying I'm next  
I don't miss my ex  
  
Je ne manque pas mon ex  
et apr猫s  
Je ne manque pas mon ex  
et apr猫s  
  
I know what you need, I make you believe  
i know you believe in me  
d茅mons dans ma t锚te  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
BACK FROM SPACE  
don't stress, I got it,  
only worry bout the profit,  
  
they wake up I bake up  
I play for the stakes ain't no free play,  
say you bawling, you ain't scoring  
I'm a high flyer, so I'm sorry,  
  
I'm high, I took the high road,  
I ain't messing with the Sci fi  
fright night, no acting  
  
  
  
  
pull up, roll up  
got her rolling all em trees  
got her and I got her on her knees  
  
Worth it/Priceless  
inestimable  
En le valeur  
  
  
Purpose(Interlude)  
First off I ain't perfect, all I know is the music  
I just work with a purpose  
cannot say when I last slept, I can tell you when I last wrote, what it feels like to be hopeless,  
own it don't hide it,  
a lot people don't have it, you gotta know your purpose  
be true,  
to you.  
I like the blues,  
ironically it's like a habit I just purchase what I can't have,  
  
everyday I gotta wake up  
& everyday I get beat down  
but everyday I make my way up  
where as most dudes wear make up  
  
i can tell your fake from very far away  
say you rocking all this bape,  
say you got the baddest bae  
I ain't even try to hate, I just can't believe you really said that  
can't believe I tried to save you  
can't believe you think I miss you  
  
more than what you see on the surface  
  
  
  
  
NEW!  
  
say you know me that's the old me  
NEW! NEW! NEW! NEW!  
nobody doing this !  
NEW!  
nobody doing this!

oh you heard I made the news.  
now you know I'm NEW!

Devil & A King  
got a shawty on her knees,  
got her saying daddy please,  
I am never what you need, I am always what you want  
  
  
Cloud 9 w/ you  
used to southside with you,  
never knew love til you  
always making love to the music  
now you got a young nigga cheating  
& you got em coming back for more  
at first.

now you got me wanting more

she ain't got manners, she ain't got no manners  
I don't do this for the hype

verse 1  
I don't do this for the hype  
your girl ain't my type

now your running all senseless  
down the street, watch out,

Turn Around

Just tell me the truth, I'm not the only one you dealing with (Truth, truth)  
  
[Verse 1: Nkosinathi Malinga]  
I've been working late, you've been on my case  
you wish I was better at communication, lately you been telling me the truest statements, I find it hard to believe that you love me and only me, I find it hard to see,  
it's gon be hard for me to give you all of me  
you hold it down for me

I'd get this crown for you, know I got

Feels like I been down this road before  
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me

NB  
after Dank it was usually like Russian roulette in my head, never knowing which personality I would in fact at times not even be aware but lately that's changed.  
  
now as soon as I blunt I feel like I can see all of them from a separate entity inside of me, it's strange but yet so so appealing even though at other times one forcefully takes over be it fate or fortune having power over me then but other times I am in control,  
  
now I will need to learn perfect times to access each of these individuals, but first I must study them and figure out their weaknesses and strengths, although I have prior memory of some incidents I will need further data to co. plete a full character trait on each entity.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Popped  
[Pre Hook: Moor Dank]  
I just popped a couple beans in my beamer, ex's see me on the beach unexpected, I gotta ex here, I gotta exit while I'm flexing, now I'm flexing like a man who got his juice juice, flexing like a man who got his juice juice(juice),  
juicy, new fruity loops.  
  
sight see me, my life-style is slightly more styled,

in my lexus forget ex's, I gotta exit, gotta exit.  
flexing like a man who got his juice juice, while I'm flexing like a man who got his juice juice,  
  
[verse 1: Moor Dank]  
bring it back, bring it back  
when you swerve like it's a wave bring it back  
when you move its like you surfin up away  
out my way, out my way  
  
new girl like Beyonc茅, thinking about the outcome, I just spent their income when you see me incoming better get some cover(Lucy)

I guess I keep talking to myself  
Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talkin' to myself  
No one seems to know my struggle and everything I come from...  
Can anybody hear me?  
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself  
It feels like I'm going insane  
Am I the one who's crazy?  
yeah, woah-woah,  
So why in the world do I feel so alone?  
Nobody but me, I'm on my own  
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?  
If there is, let me hear  
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[verse 1: Nkosinathi Malinga]  
all this hate and doubt is getting out of hand

I get respect wherever I go and I never have to pay for it.  
  
  
  
  
spent the right money, with the wrong people  
these other niggas take cheap shots they got foul lines, my ball game, Le Bron James don't play no games, can you really blame me?  
can't get pity fame that's for lame dames.  
  
everyday I had to work  
mama coming home from work,mama coming home from work she...

I never really saw the star in me but I had to shine cause it's all mine  
All mine, all the time  
now I roll right  
  
0:31  
starting from the bottom I ain't have nobody just a young boy who don't got a body, just his mitochondria , the poetry and the focus  
  
a lot people out of focus, like a camera with the wrong lens  
doing little itty bitty big things,  
my gotta have the nice ting  
  
I ain't messing with the ice chain or the pinky ring  
cell-E ring ring more than often, and my last name get you cough-ing,  
  
  
every other day people say things change, it's still the same lame page though  
you gotta act your age  
I know there's rage inside of you, you got demons too  
everybody got their own,  
  
I used to pray every other day,  
& then I started praying more & more,  
I was praying every *beep* day  
  
momma wanna see the star in me,  
I see the star in me,  
now I have to always shine,  
Lord i swear i know it's all mine, looking through you just like a window what I'm sippin is not wine,  
feel the wind blow,  
  
thought things would get better,  
now it doesn't even matter,  
said I'm growing every day and as I lay up on my bed  
I hear these voices in my head, a lot of people want me dead
