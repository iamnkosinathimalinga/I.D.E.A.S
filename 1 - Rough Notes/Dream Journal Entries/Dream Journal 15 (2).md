Partially remember being a cyborg, oh and being with my mom too and before that there was this time were in a car me my mom sindi and bheki and we wanted to buy a place and this foreign guy was playing us and my uncle cut off his ear and it was so brutal and before that I was at home with my mom and brother and sindi and she was posting her pics, and her videos or something like that, then me jnr and my mom were running to the freeway and I bumped into uLanga running opposite to me laughing and he had a gun he was also with this other girl who seemed pregnant. then I met this kid who had good food and he was rich.  
  
then I was a cyborg and Lerato was there.  
she came to pick up Nkosi and right after she got there Kamo came with some crew niggas and they had a whip and they wanted to have a session Lerato was crying because she didn't want me to leave.  
  
I think she was crying because she knows what I said to palesa. a
