Partial Entry,  
I remember having Nokbonaga over and just talking about her sister who had a child with ayanda and how ayanda got kicked out and left with the child because he refused to leave without his child, someone else was there tho, talking about how he's crazy because he didn't even think it through because he doesn't even know if they'll take him in wherever he's headed, we were at my house and to hen something strange happened, Ngungu came and as he was at the gate, my grandad saw him through the window and as I let him in we went into the two room oh and my mom and grandma were right across the street, Ngungu came with drugs and even though I had thought I put that behind me I wanted to do them with him but I noticed my grandad looking at us through the window and as he realized I saw him he walked away, for a while I was like what?! where's he going and then after a while I noticed that he had two shovels(some heavy ass shovels) and he'd been cutting grass, all within a shady time frame we weren't even done crushing the bag of drugs, anyway this guy before he asks for a gun, which I have, oddly enough since I wasn't doing drugs before, is interrupted by my Grandad and GranMa and they call us to go throw this grass and pick up these shovels far away, almost as a test to see something about the drugs, and what we were doing, so anyway before that I think I noticed my grandad was telling my gran and mom what we were doing and I tried to interrupt him by shouting out: "no it's just weed!" which he then promptly just slides off to the side like I was already too late, after that we take the shovels, heavy ass shovels I must say, and then carry them, I realise that this man is taking us the long way around for no reason or at least a nefarious one at that, so I take the sensible route(oh and like I mentioned earlier, we didn't even get a chance to do the drugs) so I tell this nigga to come with & full disclosure I'm not sure if he did, but anyway that's where things start getting weird, after that I start running with this thing & I mean full on anime style running I had powers and I was defying gravity, enhancing and growing my powers all at the same time and I was turning into a really refined user of my abilities, I could go super fast and then control multiple people at a time, for only a short period of time tho & they had this red glow in their eyes when I did, & some people were walking in dams , yeah that was weird , I think that's about all I remember for now.
