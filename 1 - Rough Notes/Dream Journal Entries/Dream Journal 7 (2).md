I remember going outside to find this other guy on a BMX e2room doing this crazy thing with pawns and some musical strings attached to them like everytime he touched the pawns they would make a note. so me and sindi watched him for a while and yeah obviously we ended up going inside and then there was a studio there and then Rooney showed up and started recording me making a song titled:  
  
Propane.  
  
<Hook>  
  
Cocaine---  
Propane---  
More Pain--  
No Fame---  
No Shame--  
  
I jus put us on, shinnin like a winter star  
  
oh and before that dream I had a dream about Palesa and her friends stealing clothes , my clothes, I don't remember why exactly but there was a reason, my mom was there too, she took someone on vacation i think it was Vuyo, because he appreciated her or something but it wasnt really Vuyo,  
oh and before that I remember racing these other guy down a huge hill and I was losing it was so far down and somehow I fell and the fall led me down a win, there was a prize and obviously the guys were shocked when I won, they were like I cheated and stuff but it was practically impossible to cheat through / down that hill, because a fall down there meant certain death, but I ended up getting the money and parts I think, because we were racing these little RC cars.  
  
oh and then I had a dream about Mdu, he wanted to join some other team which needed a food fee to join and they said no because we didn't have any valuable food and we tried other ways to join them and I ended up on a high rope hanging with one hand headed for certain death, and I don't know how I survived but I did & it was scary heading for what seemed like certain death, then he found some other guys who we tried to con into letting us into the area & that ended up turning into a smoking sesh for him and this other guy who took us to this other lady's house, she had her kids rolling crazy good joints, and molemo was there too out of nowhere then they smoked and I got a bit high from a contact high and as he was playing beats I started rapping but it was kak I think and he put on Travis Scott and after that I said something about the Kardashians destroying rappers after they leave them.  
and then I had this vision where I was with them and they were walking on water somehow. they were doing this trick where they could glide on the water, it was crazy dope tho.
