Partial Dream Entry again, last night or earlier this morning, I had a dream about being at the pool with like a lot of white people, well before that me and my mom and brother wanted to go to the pool and it looked like it was locked till a white guy parked in front of us opened the gates and voila, the pool wasn't really closed we just had to take initiative and go in, anyway when we got in there were a bunch of white people inside and there were kids doing backfills and crazy flips inside the pool, I tried to do one but I flopped and I even became afraid of doing this other flip, it was crazy, and then after that, I want to say there was something about bikes but im not sure. I literally just forgot about the whole thing rn, I had it, and now I don't.
