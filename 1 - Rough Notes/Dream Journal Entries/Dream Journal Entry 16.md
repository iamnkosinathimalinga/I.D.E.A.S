Last night I dreamt about a particularly vague chess scenario where: —{sidenote* I had a similar 'chess related dream, where the night before I had asked to be shown a particular person's true interests, and motives and in the dream, it seemed like we were opponents, and yet the person somehow kept me intrigued and so awe stricken that I was almost always one move/step behind them} 
      —this particular chess dream, although weary, since I've forgotten some of it was almost like a battle between two competitors, and with no undecided victors, I can only remember one vivid move I made with my white bishop, penetrating the seventh & eighth rank, & then it goes blank, after that I saw a vision of what seemed like a concept car[s] from a time different to ours, oh, how I wish I could draw that car, but yeah that was the extent of them.
