Once in a lifetime or in human history there is one moment or person who changes human evolution & completely shatters the norm in that timeframe. 

someone who does something so outside the box it almost feels like the idea came from an alternate time or it ripped through space & time. 

Now what I mean by Revolutionary isn't just the typical Elon Musk's & Jeff Bezos' or the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, those people aren't revolutionary they're pioneers, people who took & shaped, refined something that was already there, and made into something more adaptive, usable, worthy of a wider human market.

Revolutionary is something like Electricity, or the first Cellphone, Cars, Trains, Planes, & Art, Philosophy & so many things we take for granted now, because if you think about those initial first steps into making those things a reality it just becomes so mindblowing, because in that era or timeline I mean even the idea of those things seems insane, so it got me thinking, where do those people get those ideas, I mean it can't be out of thin air right, it had to have come from somewhere...

so my first theory was time travel, which quite frankly doesn't hold, then it became extraterrestrial intelligence, and that really seems to hold because if they aren't coming from us they have to either come from ETs or some sort of alternative area where Time and space can be manipulated. 

well I obviously haven't refined this theory yet but I'll get a crack soon enough.
