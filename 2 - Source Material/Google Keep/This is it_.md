You get on, or fall off.
I can't care about the stigma if it means I get to show up & show it all, I'm tired of being sorry for how I am. 
okay, okay, I hear you, & honestly, it's not lies, they not lies, to their surprise, oh my, he's actually going to have to try for once, & honestly that scares me more than any one of them would ever realize. 

*sigh*

I feel the weight on my shoulders & somehow I still have to show up. No jacket, no culture, destructive, disaster.
I know I say some unlawful, unnecessary things as a joke & well, I see how all of their faces change when I walk into the room, like: here's the walking tomb.
I guess when you're so used to being provoked you tend to o-fend them • doom • it's unprovoked & I'm not saying it's alright, & that doesn't make it okay,yeah I know, you right, I'm sorry!

yo, I spy a shy price hidden deep inside your pride, your eyes might, fantasize, immortalize, criticize, who, what am I? 
A lifeless hero, the finest zero?
Defined as — "he won't" never get a life he's nothing but a zero.
& oh my, to my surprise, they need the zeroes.

~ after this, everything else is counterfeit.
       how, how, how, how, how, how, how ?!!!!
~ can I disappoint you? I keep getting higher?
       please tell me how, you deny me a chance???
~ just cause I'm speaking louder?
what, should I drown in my fame? or be proud of my shame?
what's the matter, you always had her.
so, how's it I'm the one to blame? 
how on God's green earth you still on my tail?! you say you drive, so how you still far away?! how the fuck do y'all still fail?

it's okay, I knew, she grew, I'm screwed up, bent up, pent up, spent up, you wanna see? here, pull my belt up.
hahahahahhahaha.
sure, your jokes are funny, my life's tiny, but @ least I'm not whiny.
Tee, I, swear I thought you Godlier than Kanye but you barely choppin plz brah...
A few lines of code & I went colder than aroma odor, I think my mind's just stoned uh, I think I might disown me, God damn, why won't you let go huh? she let me bone dawg? I know, she knows I'm all alone hun, I mean, I'm just a loner, 
but that's only when I'm home & all on my lonesome own, 
these days I been a grown-errrr, maybe I'll take a probe-uh, maybe I'll get a magic pill & get to probing, like, who the grown one is. 
I think I'm on one, maybe I might be older than the last one, but I don't crash like no broken folders, I crack snacks like a broken phone, oh what?
you talk smackkkkk, like your mama claps uh huh? I still can't believe I boned that...
how, I can't believe she phoned at.
you thought you got me but it turns out, 
that booty talk I bought got sold out — guess , I got full, gold. fool.
it's cool I just say : Take care & miss the "who cares" 
at school I never missed the "w — hoes"
& days before you read this & realised that it was too late? 
I kicked the chair, & stood for hope. 
you stood right there while she hung the rope.

*hmmm*

Aubrey Taught Me To START FROM THE BOTTOM, that's HOW WE TOP DAWG.

Luckily I'm too beyond, the yawns, to play & flop dawg
,so I let my grandma pray on, while I contemplated & meditate on, the crayons, Im tryna find a way on, & I know, that I would've left all I had in these two weeks if I don't make it out? I'm glad I stayed on, I got  waited on, & never gave it all not even inch off, no i  never gave em, free pawn, playa's keep em on, I'm up at dawn gone, me, my dishonor, over all the beauty beauty & designer. 

that's it I'm gone.
