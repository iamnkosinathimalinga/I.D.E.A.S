# NOTE

Today's Progress was nominal. 
We managed to scrape a bare 7-Tasks off `To-Do`. 
We clocked in a measly 02H30 at the end of the day. 
& a disappointing 45mins on Home-Practice (For Structured Query Language)
I remised an average of 02H15, calculated from the missed blocks where I was idle & unable to focus. < consistency will be implemented to improve this ratio >

I'm ending the day on a stable and quite frankly satisfied notion with the progress I made today. 
Check back tomorrow.
