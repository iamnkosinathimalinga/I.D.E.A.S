# NOTE

Today went a bit slower, but was able to put in a bit of time at home and finish chapter 6 of [[SQL - Headfirst]], Daily Report: [[SQL - Headfirst#^ebf893]]


**The assignment** was giving me a bit of an issue which i estimate will need me to add approximately 4 blocks to it at home so that I can understand why my updateScore tests are failing. Other than that I can't complain, everything is a bit behind but at a manageable rate, minimum viable product is still on schedule.
