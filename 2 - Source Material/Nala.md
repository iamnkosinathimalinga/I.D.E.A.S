# NOTE

What a bloody cunt.
	You know I think for the longest time, I always feared the day when you'd eventually reveal your true self (your "not-so-holy" side, if I can even call it that) but to my surprise, the anticipation and the trepidation trumped the grand reveal. 

Today, was if not anything very enlightening, on more than one count.
	I think first and foremost, you're very gimmicky, a poser, a self-proclaiming "saint" who'd no sooner choke on her delusions than admit that she's in over her head. Don't get me wrong you're headstrong, fierce and overall a pretty decent person (at-least that's what I think  *currently* anyway) and despite all of your triumphs and tribulations, you came out pretty unscathed, considering. But God Almighty are you a selfish prick, and no that's not even touching base on your whole "being." You're a Christian through-and-through, and none the wiser for it might I add.

You're sketchy as hell, and where there's smoke...
	Honestly, I'm just as shady, if not a a lot more, alas the main difference remains our shenanigans (this is completely from my utmost subjective personal experience) -& to be fair, a lot of people aren't exactly privy or even a tad bit inclined to pondering especially  about their fucked up selves, that holds on a Global scale too. See we have this tendency of not being able to smell our own **shit**." -To put it quite plainly: It's part of the notorious "human-condition" I suppose and as much as I want to say grow up, I mean damn, I can's spout those words, let alone think them without feeling like a massive failure, and of course who the hell is going to take that from the junky-dead-beat...etc (I could go on for at least a couple more sentences I think, and that's me being a fair bit modest) -nonetheless I think my point here is that as much as it irks me and it literally makes me want to regurgitate my insides, I'm exactly the same, or in fact worse, because I was at least privy to a substantially  indifferent genetic pool and my indifference, as much as it may serve a tad bit worthwhile now and again is the reason I feel the most angst against myself, which in turn not only means I'm left smack dab in the middle of paralysis, but I get the 'awesome' and 'fun' self-prescribed mental (I can't even use the word torture here because that would not do this experience justice) -so for a lack of better diction (totally my fuck up too, I know) we'll say 'decay' & hopefully you get the picture of what it's like to be dealt a bad hand while shooting oneself in the foot. It's a double-mind-fuckery that you just can't imagine, it's one of those " you gotta try it before you knock it experiences " and boy-o'-boy is it a doozey.

I can't wait to shower you with karma.
	The sub, for this one is a bit misleading because despite my obvious distaste for your lack of self-actualization, and some fucking grit (say what you mean, do what you need, and if you can't, at least be honest about it, to if no one else, yourself) Your karma is actually pretty awesome, and every time I'm even remotely reminded of how many people have been kind to me or of how much kindness I've been blessed with, I'm a bit awe-struck, sure the number isn't over two digits but still, it says a lot about the 'lot of ya', and I for one, am not the kind to let a good deed go unpunished. So I honestly wish that whatever happens I get to show you that behind my facade of a "life" the is a tiny (extremely tiny) smidgen of "good" and dare I say repentance in a my own strangely justified way. I can't remember a time when kindness came to me when things were going "good" or "okay" those moments/highlights, and absolute feats in my opinion, are literally still to this day, staggering to even reminisce over, those moments are actual treasure troves to me, and I intend to pay each and every one of you, in more (that's the dream) or at least a modicum amount of the same earnest and genuine kindness's that you've shun among my dreadful life, and to give the same feeling of euphoric belief in our kind and in people, but yeah, I'm rabbling, point is, you've got some incoming-stuff little lady.

I'm probably 300000% responsible for fucking this whole thing up.
	Yeah, yeah, yeah, spare me. I know.
	- Excuses: none in sight.
	- Reasons: I'm a bloody idiotic wanker.
	- What were the remunerations: A lot of lonely nights, some better than others, most absolutely shite, alas, there's always something to be reaped, and as we both know our harvest was one heck of a "what the fuck, lol."
	- I literally have nothing, no "I'm sorry", no "I'll do better", no repertoire of funny stories, no comebacks, fokkol, I'm legit just a bare-minimum ugly motherfucker who couldn't keep his dick in his pants long enough to at least, if anything not have to feel responsible for where we are right now.

God, did me a kindness.
	Whether it was fated, conspired, planned or whatever the hell t'was that brought you to my ever so fucked up small little world, I am grateful, this isn't one of those, oh this is goodbye-grateful, no it's a genuine, oh-my-days, you actually impacted my life so positively in such a ridiculously short amount of time, that no words could express the profoundness of this badly written excerpt, I really want you to be my family, but as you very well know I'm fucked, can't help it, it's my "human-condition" and I accepted it, made terms, conditions, dotted the T's crossed the I's, and I have a fairly reasonable expectation of what's in store, and no matter how side-ways that goes I know that that's the deal I made, so it's a bit unfair to get you involved in that innit? So bruv, I just want to say, the craziness is real, the psychological depravity is real, the need for an "unnecessary amount of grandeur" is most certainly a real fucking thing, and with that, I wrap up today's (technically I start off today's dealings) -on a task {{completed}}, sad how that's not even good news anymore, and leave this piece with this, it's probably not worth it cuz, I honestly don't think I'm worth that much of a hassle, cut your losses and make like the wind, we both know that you're not going to lose anything too valuable, I'll be cool with you, your friends(Moms, Jnr, practically all your no.1 fans will still be there for you, minus a couple awkward  moments now and again) you get to keep doing you, never pushing beyond your reasonably satisfactory life, and we all get to live on. 


P.S
I totally thought I had a shit ton of shit to say, but it turns out it was a little over a thousand words, huh, surprising, I guess things really do seem huge in the heat of the moment, looking at it now, it's like "What-a-hell" lol, Je ne sais pais though man Nala, it's like we keep fighting one-another to make them happy, and really that's not a reason to fight someone, fight me because I'm amoral  or whatever, or because I don't post you, (that's actually another fine example of you fighting me because of some conditioning that's taken root in your mind) -but I'm sidetracking again, point is this (I think): THINK FOR YOUR FUCKING SELF, YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE, WRITE A DIFFERENT STORY, A NARRATIVE THAT HASN'T BEEN WORN-OUT SO MUCH THAT EVEN O-SHAKESPEAR COULD WRITE ABOUT, LIKE COME THE FUCK ON MAN, IS THAT ME ASKING FOR A MIRACLE? ---*(*something really cool, and concluding here, that makes you love me a whole lot, and we end up in France, or anywhere really, having conversations that don't exist in another person's domain, or that aren't fabricated...then we high five and  SCENE!)
