" Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,  
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros "  
  
â€” You will seldom find that mere men of  
the world, whatever strong sense they may be endowed with ,  
are very nice in distinguishing characters, or in marking those insensible differences and gradations which make one man pre ferable to another.
