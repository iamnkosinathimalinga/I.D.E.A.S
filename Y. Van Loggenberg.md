Y. Van Loggenberg  
  
" I definitely dont think highly of myself i just keep my business to myself. I definitely dont need admiration - i can barely accept a compliment because its awkward for me.  
Nobody is inferior to anyone - at the end of the day we are all the same just going through different obstacles.  
You clearly dont know me as well as you think you do if you think i lack empathy for others.  
  
But if you believe i am a narcissist then thats your opinion"
