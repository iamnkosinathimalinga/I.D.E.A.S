I can literally only remember my grandad doing the garden in my grandma's denim jacket, I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation but I definitely have been having trouble writing in my dream Journal, or atleast remembering the dreams long enough to write them down & I'm already a day down on my dream Journal. if I do end up remembering something from the dream from earlier this morning, I'll write them on here but for now it's just that, I feel so disconnected to be honest.
